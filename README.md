# Conway's Game Of Life


This project is Conway's Game of Life, which is a universal truing machine.   

The implementation is fair simple.   

We just need to follow up 4 roles to implement the logic.   

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.   
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.   
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.   
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
